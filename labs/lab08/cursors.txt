A cursor is returned from the db.collection.find() function. They can be assigned to a variable, with var,
and it includes a number of methods such as .next() or .hasNext().

.toArray() returns the contents of the cursor in an array.

Cursors are closed automatically after 10 minutes of inactivity, but this can be overrided with .noCursorTimeout()
